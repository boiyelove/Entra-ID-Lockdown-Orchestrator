# Entra-ID-Lockdown-Orchestrator

Contain high-risk Entra identities rapidly while preserving analyst control and forensic evidence.

## Problem statement

A high-risk sign-in event is validated and deduplicated before planning account isolation, session revocation, evidence capture, and a protected break-glass exception.

A production implementation can still fail even when every resource deploys successfully. The material risk is invisible trust expansion: a subject, tenant, group, or session gains access beyond the exact relationship its owner approved. The design therefore treats Entra ID, Sentinel, Logic Apps, and the surrounding identity and evidence controls as one reviewable system rather than unrelated configuration tasks.

## Example case study

### Situation

A SOC analyst loses critical minutes manually disabling compromised users and revoking sessions across tools. The orchestrator makes the response repeatable while protecting emergency identities and preserving evidence for investigation.

### Response

A privileged account produces a risky sign-in followed by suspicious directory activity. The orchestrator correlates signals, revokes sessions once, opens the response record, and preserves a controlled recovery path for false positives.

The team first exercises the repository's synthetic approved and denied fixtures. An approved request must produce the same idempotent plan on replay; a stale, unscoped, public, or unapproved request must fail before an Azure adapter is allowed to run.

### Expected outcome

Stakeholders receive a decision package they can attach to a change record: requested scope, controls evaluated, the reason for approval or denial, and the explicit handoff to live integration. The example supports design review and incident rehearsal without pretending that a local test changed Azure.

## Architecture

Sentinel analytics create incidents that invoke a Logic Apps playbook. Functions enrich risk, validate protected-account policy, disable or restrict the identity, revoke tokens through Graph, notify analysts, and attach every action to the incident.

Primary services: `Entra ID`, `Sentinel`, `Logic Apps`, `Functions`, `Microsoft Graph`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

The upper boundary names the principal services and technologies used by this repository. The lower boundary shows the implemented control flow: desired state is validated, provider action remains an explicit integration gate, and sanitized evidence is retained for review and deterministic replay.

Azure product icons come from [Microsoft's official Azure Architecture Icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/icons/). Open-source marks are sourced from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) when shown; each mark identifies its respective technology.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md) and [`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.
